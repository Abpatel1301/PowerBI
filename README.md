**Business Intelligence Analyst Course Project**

Welcome to the Business Intelligence Analyst Course Project repository! In this project, I took on the role of a Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. The goal was to transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.
